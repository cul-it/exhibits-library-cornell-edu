## Administering your exhibit - Dashboard

When you are first using Spotlight, it may be helpful to click through the items in the dashboard navigation to see what types of features and configurations are available. Below is a brief summary of each of the dashboard sections.

### Dashboard

The dashboard home page, which displays recent exhibit-building activity.

### Analytics

While this is not currently configured, analytics providers can be integrated into the exhibit dashboard.

### Configuration

#### General

This section contains basic exhibit settings, such as exhibit title, subtitle, description, tags and contacts. This is also where you can choose to publish your exhibit. You can also choose to filter items here, as well as import and export data, and delete your exhibit.

#### Appearance

This section is where you can set the masthead image in your exhibit's header, set an exhibit thumbnail (for display on the CUL Exhibits home page) and set what items you would like to appear in your exhibit's main menu.
