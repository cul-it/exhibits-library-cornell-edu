When you first use Spotlight, it may be helpful to click through the items in the dashboard navigation to see what types of features and configurations are available. Below is a brief summary of each of the dashboard sections.

### Dashboard

The dashboard home page, which displays recent exhibit-building activity.

### Analytics

While this is not currently configured, analytics providers can be integrated into the exhibit dashboard.

## Configuration

### General

This section contains basic exhibit settings, such as:

* Exhibit title
* Subtitle
* Description
* Tags
* Contacts

This is also where you can choose to publish your exhibit, filter items, import and export data, and delete your exhibit.

### Appearance

This section is where you can set the masthead image in your exhibit's header, an exhibit thumbnail (for display on the CUL Exhibitios home page) and set what items you would like to appear in your exhibit's main menu.

### Users

The Users section contains a list of users configured for that particular exhibition, as well as the ability to edit or remove users.

### Metadata

Spotlight items come with the following default metadata fields:

* Title
* Description
* Attribution
* Date
* Tags

In the Metadata section, you can configure whether or not these fields are displayed on an item view, or in list gallery, masonry or slideshow views.

In addition, you can add custom, exhibit-specific fields in this section.

#### Metadata fields for display

Metadata fields can be configured to display on List, Gallery, Masonry and Slideshow layouts. Please note that for the Masonry view, even though you can select multiple fields for display, only the Title field will actually be shown.

### Search

In the Search section, you can enable the display of a site-wide search box, as well as define what fields are searchable.

## Curation

The Items section is where you upload images for use throughout your exhibition. To upload images, click the "Add items" button.
