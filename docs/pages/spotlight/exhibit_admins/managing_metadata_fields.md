Access from the [Exhibit Dashboard](exhibit_dashboard_for_admins) under Configuration section clicking Metadata in the left side bar menu.

## Setting the Exhibit Title, etc.

Spotlight items come with the following default metadata fields:

* Title
* Description
* Attribution
* Date
* Tags

In the Metadata section, you can configure whether or not these fields are displayed on an item view, or in list gallery, masonry or slideshow views.

In addition, you can add custom, exhibit-specific fields in this section.

### Metadata fields for display

Metadata fields can be configured to display on List, Gallery, Masonry and Slideshow layouts. Please note that for the Masonry view, even though you can select multiple fields for display, only the Title field will actually be shown.
