## Widget Description

The Pages Widget provides a way to add a link to other pages in your exhibit.  This will look best if the pages you select have a thumbnail image.

## Using the Widget

### Common Steps for All Widgets

* Login
* View the page you want to edit
* Click the Edit button

### Add Pages

* Click the plus sign where you want to add the links to the pages.

### Remove Pages

You can remove a page by hiding it or removing it from the pages widget.

#### Hide Page

* To keep a page in the pages widget, but hide it on the display of the page, edit the page and unselect the check mark beside the page you want to hide.  You can later show the page again by clicking the box so that it displays the checkmark.

* To remove the page from the pages widget, click the Remove link to the right of the page you want to remove.

* In both cases, when you save the page, only the one visible page will be displayed.

### Gotchas

#### 3 page limit

> _This is documented in [Issue #448](https://github.com/cul-it/exhibits-library-cornell-edu/issues/448).  
>You can check this issue to see if the status has changed or been resolved._

The widget will allow you to select more than 3 pages, but it will not display more than 3 pages.  And if more than 5 are selected, it will be displayed as text only and potentially overlapping with other widgets on the page.

__Workaround:__ 

__It is recommended that you not select more than 3 pages.__

__If you need more than 3 pages, add a second pages widget below the first and select up to 3 more pages for the second pages widget.  You can continue to add pages widgets as needed to get links to all the pages you want.__
