## Requesting a new exhibit

To create an exhibit, please email E. Lynette Rayle (elr37@cornell.edu) with a title and a brief description of your exhibit.

For ideas on what your finished exhibition in Spotlight can look like, explore [Cornell Online Exhibitions](http://exhibits.library.cornell.edu) or [Stanford Online Exhibits](http://exhibits.stanford.edu).
